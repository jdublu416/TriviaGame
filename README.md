# TriviaGame

This project originated as a homework assignment for the University of Richmond Bootcamp. The object of the assignment is to learn the use of timers while deepening one's understanding of all the previously learned topics to include CSS, jquery/javascript, media queries, and global/local scope. 

The game is based on a simple trivia quiz that takes 5 questions to be answered in a set amount of time. The user will navigate the site with a start button and be able to pick one answer. The user will be able to end game prior to both the questions not being completed and the timer running to zero. The user will use a reset button to clear the timer and restart the page. The game will end after the 5th question is answered, the timer gets to zero, or the user clicks the end game button. 

The results will be displayed with the amount of time it took to complete the quiz. With only 5 questions in this very basic game, I opted to not provide whether the user answered the question correctly so he can replay the quiz and try again.
